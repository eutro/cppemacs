<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation,</div>
<div class="line">Inc. &lt;https://fsf.org/&gt;</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this</div>
<div class="line">license document, but changing it is not allowed.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 0. PREAMBLE</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other</div>
<div class="line">functional and useful document &quot;free&quot; in the sense of freedom: to</div>
<div class="line">assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it,</div>
<div class="line">with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.</div>
<div class="line">Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way</div>
<div class="line">to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible</div>
<div class="line">for modifications made by others.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This License is a kind of &quot;copyleft&quot;, which means that derivative</div>
<div class="line">works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It</div>
<div class="line">complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft</div>
<div class="line">license designed for free software.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free</div>
<div class="line">software, because free software needs free documentation: a free</div>
<div class="line">program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the</div>
<div class="line">software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it</div>
<div class="line">can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or</div>
<div class="line">whether it is published as a printed book. We recommend this License</div>
<div class="line">principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 1. APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium, that</div>
<div class="line">contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be</div>
<div class="line">distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a</div>
<div class="line">world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that</div>
<div class="line">work under the conditions stated herein. The &quot;Document&quot;, below, refers</div>
<div class="line">to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee,</div>
<div class="line">and is addressed as &quot;you&quot;. You accept the license if you copy, modify</div>
<div class="line">or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright</div>
<div class="line">law.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">A &quot;Modified Version&quot; of the Document means any work containing the</div>
<div class="line">Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with</div>
<div class="line">modifications and/or translated into another language.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">A &quot;Secondary Section&quot; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of</div>
<div class="line">the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the</div>
<div class="line">publishers or authors of the Document to the Document&#39;s overall</div>
<div class="line">subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall</div>
<div class="line">directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in</div>
<div class="line">part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain</div>
<div class="line">any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical</div>
<div class="line">connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,</div>
<div class="line">commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding</div>
<div class="line">them.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The &quot;Invariant Sections&quot; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles</div>
<div class="line">are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice</div>
<div class="line">that says that the Document is released under this License. If a</div>
<div class="line">section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not</div>
<div class="line">allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero</div>
<div class="line">Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant</div>
<div class="line">Sections then there are none.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The &quot;Cover Texts&quot; are certain short passages of text that are listed,</div>
<div class="line">as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that</div>
<div class="line">the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be</div>
<div class="line">at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">A &quot;Transparent&quot; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,</div>
<div class="line">represented in a format whose specification is available to the</div>
<div class="line">general public, that is suitable for revising the document</div>
<div class="line">straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of</div>
<div class="line">pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available</div>
<div class="line">drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or</div>
<div class="line">for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input</div>
<div class="line">to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file</div>
<div class="line">format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart</div>
<div class="line">or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.</div>
<div class="line">An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount</div>
<div class="line">of text. A copy that is not &quot;Transparent&quot; is called &quot;Opaque&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain</div>
<div class="line">ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML</div>
<div class="line">or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple</div>
<div class="line">HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of</div>
<div class="line">transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats</div>
<div class="line">include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by</div>
<div class="line">proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or</div>
<div class="line">processing tools are not generally available, and the</div>
<div class="line">machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word</div>
<div class="line">processors for output purposes only.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The &quot;Title Page&quot; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,</div>
<div class="line">plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material</div>
<div class="line">this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in</div>
<div class="line">formats which do not have any title page as such, &quot;Title Page&quot; means</div>
<div class="line">the text near the most prominent appearance of the work&#39;s title,</div>
<div class="line">preceding the beginning of the body of the text.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The &quot;publisher&quot; means any person or entity that distributes copies of</div>
<div class="line">the Document to the public.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">A section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; means a named subunit of the Document whose</div>
<div class="line">title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following</div>
<div class="line">text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a</div>
<div class="line">specific section name mentioned below, such as &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Dedications&quot;, &quot;Endorsements&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;.) To &quot;Preserve the Title&quot;</div>
<div class="line">of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a</div>
<div class="line">section &quot;Entitled XYZ&quot; according to this definition.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which</div>
<div class="line">states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty</div>
<div class="line">Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this</div>
<div class="line">License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other</div>
<div class="line">implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has</div>
<div class="line">no effect on the meaning of this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 2. VERBATIM COPYING</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either</div>
<div class="line">commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the</div>
<div class="line">copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies</div>
<div class="line">to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no</div>
<div class="line">other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use</div>
<div class="line">technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further</div>
<div class="line">copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept</div>
<div class="line">compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough</div>
<div class="line">number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and</div>
<div class="line">you may publicly display copies.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have</div>
<div class="line">printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the</div>
<div class="line">Document&#39;s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the</div>
<div class="line">copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover</div>
<div class="line">Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on</div>
<div class="line">the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you</div>
<div class="line">as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the</div>
<div class="line">full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible.</div>
<div class="line">You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with</div>
<div class="line">changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of</div>
<div class="line">the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim</div>
<div class="line">copying in other respects.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit</div>
<div class="line">legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit</div>
<div class="line">reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent</div>
<div class="line">pages.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering</div>
<div class="line">more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent</div>
<div class="line">copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy</div>
<div class="line">a computer-network location from which the general network-using</div>
<div class="line">public has access to download using public-standard network protocols</div>
<div class="line">a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material.</div>
<div class="line">If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps,</div>
<div class="line">when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure</div>
<div class="line">that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated</div>
<div class="line">location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an</div>
<div class="line">Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that</div>
<div class="line">edition to the public.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the</div>
<div class="line">Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to</div>
<div class="line">give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the</div>
<div class="line">Document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 4. MODIFICATIONS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under</div>
<div class="line">the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release</div>
<div class="line">the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified</div>
<div class="line">Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution</div>
<div class="line">and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy</div>
<div class="line">of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">-   A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title</div>
<div class="line">    distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous</div>
<div class="line">    versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the</div>
<div class="line">    History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a</div>
<div class="line">    previous version if the original publisher of that version</div>
<div class="line">    gives permission.</div>
<div class="line">-   B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or</div>
<div class="line">    entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the</div>
<div class="line">    Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal</div>
<div class="line">    authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has</div>
<div class="line">    fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement.</div>
<div class="line">-   C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the</div>
<div class="line">    Modified Version, as the publisher.</div>
<div class="line">-   D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.</div>
<div class="line">-   E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications</div>
<div class="line">    adjacent to the other copyright notices.</div>
<div class="line">-   F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license</div>
<div class="line">    notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version</div>
<div class="line">    under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the</div>
<div class="line">    Addendum below.</div>
<div class="line">-   G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant</div>
<div class="line">    Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document&#39;s</div>
<div class="line">    license notice.</div>
<div class="line">-   H. Include an unaltered copy of this License.</div>
<div class="line">-   I. Preserve the section Entitled &quot;History&quot;, Preserve its Title,</div>
<div class="line">    and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new</div>
<div class="line">    authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the</div>
<div class="line">    Title Page. If there is no section Entitled &quot;History&quot; in the</div>
<div class="line">    Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and</div>
<div class="line">    publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an</div>
<div class="line">    item describing the Modified Version as stated in the</div>
<div class="line">    previous sentence.</div>
<div class="line">-   J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document</div>
<div class="line">    for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and</div>
<div class="line">    likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous</div>
<div class="line">    versions it was based on. These may be placed in the &quot;History&quot;</div>
<div class="line">    section. You may omit a network location for a work that was</div>
<div class="line">    published at least four years before the Document itself, or if</div>
<div class="line">    the original publisher of the version it refers to</div>
<div class="line">    gives permission.</div>
<div class="line">-   K. For any section Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot; or &quot;Dedications&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">    Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all</div>
<div class="line">    the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements</div>
<div class="line">    and/or dedications given therein.</div>
<div class="line">-   L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered</div>
<div class="line">    in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the</div>
<div class="line">    equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.</div>
<div class="line">-   M. Delete any section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;. Such a section may</div>
<div class="line">    not be included in the Modified Version.</div>
<div class="line">-   N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled</div>
<div class="line">    &quot;Endorsements&quot; or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.</div>
<div class="line">-   O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or</div>
<div class="line">appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material</div>
<div class="line">copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all</div>
<div class="line">of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the</div>
<div class="line">list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version&#39;s license notice.</div>
<div class="line">These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may add a section Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;, provided it contains</div>
<div class="line">nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various</div>
<div class="line">partiesâ€”for example, statements of peer review or that the text has</div>
<div class="line">been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a</div>
<div class="line">standard.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a</div>
<div class="line">passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list</div>
<div class="line">of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of</div>
<div class="line">Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or</div>
<div class="line">through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already</div>
<div class="line">includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or</div>
<div class="line">by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,</div>
<div class="line">you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit</div>
<div class="line">permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License</div>
<div class="line">give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or</div>
<div class="line">imply endorsement of any Modified Version.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may combine the Document with other documents released under this</div>
<div class="line">License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified</div>
<div class="line">versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the</div>
<div class="line">Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and</div>
<div class="line">list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its</div>
<div class="line">license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and</div>
<div class="line">multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single</div>
<div class="line">copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but</div>
<div class="line">different contents, make the title of each such section unique by</div>
<div class="line">adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original</div>
<div class="line">author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number.</div>
<div class="line">Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of</div>
<div class="line">Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled &quot;History&quot;</div>
<div class="line">in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled</div>
<div class="line">&quot;History&quot;; likewise combine any sections Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">and any sections Entitled &quot;Dedications&quot;. You must delete all sections</div>
<div class="line">Entitled &quot;Endorsements&quot;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other</div>
<div class="line">documents released under this License, and replace the individual</div>
<div class="line">copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy</div>
<div class="line">that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules</div>
<div class="line">of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all</div>
<div class="line">other respects.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may extract a single document from such a collection, and</div>
<div class="line">distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a</div>
<div class="line">copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this</div>
<div class="line">License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that</div>
<div class="line">document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate</div>
<div class="line">and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or</div>
<div class="line">distribution medium, is called an &quot;aggregate&quot; if the copyright</div>
<div class="line">resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights</div>
<div class="line">of the compilation&#39;s users beyond what the individual works permit.</div>
<div class="line">When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not</div>
<div class="line">apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves</div>
<div class="line">derivative works of the Document.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these</div>
<div class="line">copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of</div>
<div class="line">the entire aggregate, the Document&#39;s Cover Texts may be placed on</div>
<div class="line">covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the</div>
<div class="line">electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form.</div>
<div class="line">Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole</div>
<div class="line">aggregate.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 8. TRANSLATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may</div>
<div class="line">distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4.</div>
<div class="line">Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special</div>
<div class="line">permission from their copyright holders, but you may include</div>
<div class="line">translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the</div>
<div class="line">original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a</div>
<div class="line">translation of this License, and all the license notices in the</div>
<div class="line">Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include</div>
<div class="line">the original English version of this License and the original versions</div>
<div class="line">of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between</div>
<div class="line">the translation and the original version of this License or a notice</div>
<div class="line">or disclaimer, the original version will prevail.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">If a section in the Document is Entitled &quot;Acknowledgements&quot;,</div>
<div class="line">&quot;Dedications&quot;, or &quot;History&quot;, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve</div>
<div class="line">its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual</div>
<div class="line">title.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 9. TERMINATION</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document</div>
<div class="line">except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise</div>
<div class="line">to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will</div>
<div class="line">automatically terminate your rights under this License.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license</div>
<div class="line">from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,</div>
<div class="line">unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally</div>
<div class="line">terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder</div>
<div class="line">fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to</div>
<div class="line">60 days after the cessation.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is</div>
<div class="line">reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the</div>
<div class="line">violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have</div>
<div class="line">received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that</div>
<div class="line">copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after</div>
<div class="line">your receipt of the notice.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the</div>
<div class="line">licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under</div>
<div class="line">this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently</div>
<div class="line">reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does</div>
<div class="line">not give you any rights to use it.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">## 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the</div>
<div class="line">GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions</div>
<div class="line">will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in</div>
<div class="line">detail to address new problems or concerns. See</div>
<div class="line">&lt;https://www.gnu.org/licenses/&gt;.</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number.</div>
<div class="line">If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this</div>
<div class="line">License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the option of</div>
<div class="line">following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or</div>
<div class="line">of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the</div>
<div class="line">Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version</div>
<div class="line">number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not</div>
<div class="line">as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies</div>
<div class="line">that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be</div>
<div class="line">used, that proxy&#39;s public statement of acceptance of a version</div>
<div class="line">permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document.</div>

<div class="line">## ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</div>
<div class="line"> </div>
<div class="line">To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of</div>
<div class="line">the License in the document and put the following copyright and</div>
<div class="line">license notices just after the title page:</div>
